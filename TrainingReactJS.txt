What is React JS?

react js is a javascript library for building user interfaces .it is the most popular front end development tool currently in use

What are the advantages of React JS?

-> Easy to write code and light weight 
-> Reusable component based 
   ex: login component for employee
       users : agents,students 
       Generic component login can be re-used for all type of        users -- reusable component
-> Design simple views for your application
-> Not too hard to learn 
-> React makes it painless to create interactive UI's 

what is the demand for React JS?

  react js is one of the most demanded in market
  some of the tech companies like paypal,netflix,facebook,ebay etc

what is the demand for job opportunites?

what is javascript ? 

   javascript is a programming language mainly scripting language which we can use to develop any type of application(Web development)
   client side scripting language 

   when you request for a webpage and you get a static content

   when we request for a webpage we get a dynamic content 

History of Javascript 

  javascript is backward compatible 
 
  1990 -> HTML, CSS , Webpage(static) 

  1993 -> mosaic Netscape was commercialised 

  Microsoft came up with Internet Explorer with Windows 

  java was gaining poplurity 

  Netscape hired brendien eide working on schema programming language

  in 10 days a small language was developed and the name of the language was mocha , changed to LiveScript

  Javascript -> Netscape Navigator2 

  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Microsoft did  a reverse engineering ,developed a new language called JScript

  Netscape went to ECMA -> basically to create standards 

  ECMA -> European Computers Manufacturers Association 

  ECMA Script rules 

  1999 huge loss  then made Netscape as Opensource -> Mozilla 

  ECMA SCRIPT 1 , .. 2 , ES -7 , ES -8 , ES 2015 , ES 2017 , ES 2021 

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Jscript and Action Scripts were no more used 

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 javascript was interpreted language 

   ->  in other whole code gets get compiled -> converted to machine undersandable -> executed
   -> line by line execution is carrried out 

google came up with Google Chrome (V8 engine for javascript) 

  -> compiled and interpreted 
  -> JIT (just in time compiler) 

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  start to write the code and find a platform to run the javascript 

  2021 and later all the browsers have come up with an engine 

what are the options to write javascript code ?

 -> Online Editors 
 -> Offline Editors (Microsoft Visual Studio code) 
 -> IDE(Integrated Development Environment) 

Install Visual Studio Code 
   -> install live-server extension 

  Values and Variables 

   value is a smallest unit of information that exist 

   let firstName = "amazing";
    -- variable named firstName is created in memory 
   
   -> used to store data
   -> can be loaded as container

     Rules for declaring variable names

    -> must contain only letter,digit or $ and _ symbol
    -> Must begin with a letter or _ (underscore)
    -> it should not use any keywords like let , else;
    -> Variables are case sensitive
    -> Camel case 

=========================================================================================

      Data Types in Javascript 

      There are 7 Primitive Data Types

      1. Number -> Floating Point Numbers used for decimals and integers ex: let age=31


      2. String : Sequence of characters ex: let firstName = "John"
      3. Boolean : logical type that can be only true or false
      4. Undefined : Value taken by a variable that is not yet defined 

      5. Null : Also means empty value ;
      6.Symbol(ES2015) : Value that is unique and cannot be changed
      7. BigInt(ES2020): Larger Integers that Number type can hold

    Strings
       \ -> escape character to cancel special meaning 

     javascript has dynamic typing 

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  let ,const and var 

   let is one of the way for declaring variables

   ES6

   var is one of the way for declaring variables 

   const  
   
   const birthYear = 1991;
   let age = 31; 

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Operators
  
  An Operator is a symbol that represents an action or process 
 
  let sum = 10+20;

 -> Arithmetic Operators(+,-,*,/,%, **,++,--)
 -> Assigment Operator (x=y, +=,-=, 
 -> Comparison Operator( == , ===, != ,!==,>,<,>=,<= ) 
 -> Logical Operator ( && logical AND(returns true if both conditions are true), || logical OR(returns true if one condition is met),! logical NOT)
 -> Type Operator(typeof,instanceof)
 -> Bitwise Operator(binary representation)(&,!,^,~,>>,<<)

  == doesnt work with datatype of variable it only works with content
  === works with content an data type as well 

  Typeof Operator

  -- typeof [ returns the type of variable]
  -- instanceof[ Returns true if an object is instance of same object type(particular class),return is boolean)



    Assignment1
  
  /*
Mark and John are trying to compare their BMI (Body Mass Index), 
which is calculated using the formula: BMI = mass / height ** 2 = mass / (height * height). (mass in kg and height in meter).
1. Store Mark's and John's mass and height in variables
2. Calculate both their BMIs using the formula (you can even implement both versions)
3. Create a boolean variable 'markHigherBMI' containing information about whether Mark has a higher BMI than John.
TEST DATA 1: Marks weights 78 kg and is 1.69 m tall. John weights 92 kg and is 1.95 m tall.
TEST DATA 2: Marks weights 95 kg and is 1.88 m tall. John weights 85 kg and is 1.76 m tall.
GOOD LUCK ðŸ˜€
*/ 

//step1
const heightMark = 1.69;
const heightJohn = 1.95;
const massJohn = 92;
const massMark = 78;

//step2 
let BMIMark = massMark/heightMark ** 2;
let BMIJohn = massJohn/(heightJohn * heightJohn);

const markHigherBMI = BMIMark > BMIJohn ;

console.log("Higher BMI ------",markHigherBMI);

===================================================================================

functions 

 -- basic building blocks of real time javascript 

modes in javascript 

  - secure mode and unsecure mode
  - strict mode

  return the data as well

Function declarations and Expressions 

 function fruitProcessor(apples,oranges){
    //console.log(apples,oranges);
    const juice = `Juice with ${apples} and ${oranges}`;
    return juice ;
}

  const calcAge = function(birthYear){
    return  2037 - birthYear;
}


 ===Arrow Functions ==================

  -> lot easier and faster to write
  -> we dont need curly braces
  -> return happens implicitly (no return keyword)

    const yearsUntilRetirement = (birthYear,age) => {
   // const age = 2037 - birthYear;
    const retirementYears = (2037 - birthYear) - age;
    return retirementYears;
 }

===================================================================

 functions calling other functions

  function cutPieces(fruit){
    return fruit*4;
  }
  function fruitProcessor(apples,oranges){
    const applePieces = cutPieces(apples);
    const orangePieces = cutPieces(oranges);
    const juice = `Juice with ${applePieces} pieces of apples and ${orangePieces} pieces of orange`;
    return juice ;
  }
 -> Code Reusability 


==============================================================================================

  Arrays 

  -> storing a list of items

  -> Array is not a primitive data type 
  -> Mutate Arrays
  -> Whole Signature cannot be replaced with const 

  Basic Operations on Array 

   Adding Elements - push
   Removing Elements -- pop

   shift(remove the elements at beginning) and unshift(add elements at beginning) 

   indexOf method and includes 

==============================================================================================

  Objects 

  data [ firstName : john,lastName : schmed]

  const data = { firstName : "John" , lastName :"Schmed" } 
 
  { } -> Object literal syntax 

  In arrays order matters a lot and how we access the elements 
  in objects it is unstructured data 

  Dot and Bracket Notation

  .(object properties) and [](express evaluation)

 how we can add property to object?
 
  . and [] for adding 

  access functions in objects
  this reference

==============================================================================================

  Scope -> visibility of an element (variables,functions,objects)

  Synchronous way of execution  

  Callbacks(achieve Asynchronous way of programming)

==========================================================================================

 A callback function is a function that is passed as an argument to another function to be "called back" at a later time

  The function which takes callback as argument is treated as higher -order functions

  example(real time example)

==================================================================================================

  Object Oriented Programming 

  objects is a data structure used as a container to store the data(property and value)

  object oriented programming is a programming paradigm based on the concept of objects

  objects are building blocks of applications and interact with one another 

  Why does OOP exist?

    -> it is very hard to maintain large code bases
   
    -> most widely used programming paradigm in large scale software engineering 

  in Traditional OOP we can achieve this object concepts by classes (Blue print of objects)
 
  User {
    
         userName
         password
         email
         login(pwd){
         }
         sendMessage(str){
         }
   } 
 ======================================================================================================
 
  Prototype -- property

  when we create functions,array,object , javascript engine adds a property inside a function,array,object.

  Prototype property is basically an object where we can attach methods and properties 

  Arrays ->  the operations associated with array is in my prototype object

  defining any method using prototype keyword (prototype object) 


====================================================================================================

  Array is inherting the methods from Prototype Object 

====================================================================================================

  AJAX -> Asynchronous Javascript(callbacks) and XML

  AJAX is not a programming language its a programming concept

  => using callbacks we can acheive asynchronous way of programming 
  => Application Programming Interface

 -> Reads data from a web server after the page has loaded
 -> Updates the page(Element Content) without reloading the page
 -> send data to web server in the background

  Approach 1: XMLHttpRequest Object to make Ajax call . XMLHttpRequest() 

  Approach 2 : we will use jQuery to make an ajax calls .

  Approach 3: fetch() API which is used to make XMLHttpRequest  .flexible structure 
============================================================================================

  Promises -> 
 
 -> in callbacks there is a situtaion called callback hell(nesting the callbacks)
 -> Promises are used to achieve asynchronous operation 

  A promise is in one of the these states

  -> Pending : Initial state
  -> fulfilled : that operation was completed successfully
  -> rejected  : that operation has failed 

  Advantages of Promises

 -> Improves Code Readability
 -> Better handling of asynchronous operations
 -> Better flow of control and better Error handling
==========================================================================================
Filter and Maps

 filter() -> returns a new array containing the elements that passes a certain criteria

 let oldArray = [];
 let newArray = oldArray.filter(currentValue,index,array){
 }

 Map => if we want our resultant to be mapped to some values 

==============================================================================================

  Javascript Modules 
 
 => was introduced in ES6 and later 
 => splitting our code into seperate components 
 => very easy to maintain and organize

  exports and imports in javascript 

 import {default as doubleUtil} from './utils.js';
 import {double} from './utils.js';

===============================================================================================

  Crash Course on HTML and CSS

  HTML => Hyper Text MarkUp Language 
  => develop static pages
  => content visibility 

  invented by Sir Tim Berneers Lee in late 1990's

  HTML as Document 
  => Head Section  => describe the settings of my page 
  => Body(Content) => content of the page 

 HTML Elements => elements starting with open and close tags
 Attributes => additional information about my element

 ID => to be unique
 Class => multiple

 Apply space around Html element => padding

 CSS Box Model => fundamental part of CSS how elements are displayed on web pages

  Content : text ,images
  Padding: area around the content
  Border : goes aroung padding and content
  Margin: space between boxes
  Fill Area: area that gets filled with background-color

=====================================================================================

  Using HTMl and CSS 
  Create form -> inputs -> fetch apis
  display on Ui(API Response)
  Module1 ->fetch the data -> Module2
  Module2 ->HTML 

  build User Interfaces
  React JS is a javascript library 

  => splitting the code into seperate into functionalities
  => Components 

  Disadvantages

  => create => manage => route 
  => SEO => multipage => multiple pages = single page => only one page

   Rendering => display HTML Elements 
   DOM => Document Object Model = creates 

   Virtual DOM

   Add React to a Website â€“ React (reactjs.org)
   
   Visual Studio Code
   Live Server
   ES7-Enable

   https://reactjs.org/docs/cdn-links.html

   https://reactjs.org/docs/react-dom.html

   https://reactjs.org/docs/dom-elements.html

   https://babeljs.io/docs/en/

   const element = <h1>Hello, world!</h1>;

   JSX

   Combine both HTML and javascript in one container called JSX

   https://reactjs.org/docs/components-and-props.html

  Components 
 
 => very very simple and effective way of loading content into Single Page Application
 => independent reusable pieces

   Functional Components and Class Components

   function(){
   }

   class content extends React.Component(){
   }
  => Functional Component with Properties(parameters)
     Pure Functions 

    Parent and Child Component

  hierarchy => div(root) => div => h1(Header) => h4 => h1(Footer)

  react 
  react-dom

  Virtual DOM 
  using VS-CODE we have seen react app 
  js -> createElement
  ReactDOM.render()

  React Component LifeCycle

  Constructor -> Specific to class 
  State => Change in Component 

  Node and NPM

  npx create-react-app sampleapp
  localhost:3000 

   https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/getting-started/introduction/

  https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/web/css/flex

  Bootstrap => Responsive Web Design 

  mobile-first 

 Screen Resolution : 1963 * 1000 => Element Size => 60 px

 Screen Resolution : 1973 * 2000 => Element Size => 60px

 Screen Resolution : 1563* 800 => Element Size => 60px

 CSS Precedance => Inline -> Internal -> External

 !important 

  marquee tag will not work in all the browsers 
 https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/components/carousel/

 1368*725 => avoid flickering , blurring of images 

 12 columns => container 
 small device will be having 12 columns => ? 1 image
 medium device will be having 6 columns =? more width => 2 images
 large device will be having 4 columns =? more width => 3 images 

https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Open+Sans
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Sofia">

          }

 Font-Awesome icons 

  <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/font-awesome/4.7.0/css/font-awesome.min.css">

==================================================================================================================================

 React 

 Public Folder
 1. static fonts
 2. images
 3. HTML files
 
 React Project Dependencies

  React and React DOM
  npm install => install dependencies(real) node_modules

  To add a dependency(package ) to the project

  1. npm install <<packageName>> package.json => recommended
  2. directly make changes in package .json (add dependency and version) 

  dependency and dev dependency 

  dependencies => react ,react-dom => nom install react

  dev dependency => only used by developer 
                    eslint, prittier,dayjs => format the code 

  npm install --save-dev dayjs
 
  Exports 

  => Named Export
  => Default Export 

  useEffect
  Functional Hooks
  Hook Method and rules

  React Fragment
  
  we can avoid dummy divs(parent elements) using React.Fragment 

  3 ways
  
 1. <React.Fragment>
 2. <Fragment> = Named Export 
 3. <> </>

 React Props 
 =================================================================

 props can be used to pass data from parent to child component

 attributes to Components

 1. Props can be destructured for easy usage
 2. Props can have default values
 3. Props will take default value as true if no value is passed
 4. Passing object as props , Spread Operator

  destructuring of object in react 

  const userData = { name:"Kumar", age:50 }

  const {name,age} = userData;
  
  https://developer.mozilla.org/enUS/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Destructuring_assignment

  Math.min(1,2,3); //1

  let array = [1,2,3];
 
  Math.min(array); // NaN

  Math.min(...array) //1

 
==========================================================================================
 Conditional Rendering

 Based on Some condition we want to show our content or not

 1. Show or Hide Component
 2. Implementing the Role Based Permission Level
 3. Toggling Functionalities(switch between components)

  Once you have built the components 
  
  Comments
  
  README.md
   1. What is the purpose of the component
   2. what is props
   3. does it handle errors 

  Use of Story Book
  https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/get-started/introduction

 Situation

  1. one situation is present so i have two results
 
  => if operator =>login => execute UserGreeting else GuestGreeting (if )
  conditional operator ternary 

  => condition ? if true this will return: if false this will return 

  2. logical AND (&&)  -- only one expected result

     const value = true && "license";

     age>18 && <DrivingLicense/>

     true && true => t
     false && true => f
     true && false => f
     false && false => f
